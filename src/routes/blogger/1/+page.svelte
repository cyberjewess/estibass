		<h2>Too Hot in L.A.</h2>
		<h3>September 16, 2024</h3>
		<p>
			Lately I've been thinking and reading about climate change. We've just lived through the
			hottest summer on record. Currently, Poland is flooding. Parts of Africa are flooding. It's 77
			degrees in Brooklyn today in mid-September; I'm still running my AC. Things are changing but
			not fast enough, not dramatically enough.
		</p>
		<p>
			The problem is so vast, it is easy to get lost in anxiety trying to grapple with it. We must
			dramatically curtail carbon and methane emissions; this means an end to industrial animal
			agriculture, car dependent societies, fast international shipping, coal burning, fossil fuel
			burning, natural gas AKA methane burning. We must build solar, wind, hydro, and nuclear power.
			We must build convenient rail connections between towns and cities. We must redesign cities to
			prioritize public transit, biking, and walking. How are we supposed to do all of this?
		</p>
		<p>
			I don't have the answer. Some people claim to. The free market is only able to do so much;
			short term profit is still king, and the true risk and cost of climate collapse is not priced
			into the market. Shouldn't oil extraction companies be much less valuable, seeing as their
			continued existence ensures the ruin of society as we know it? I do not understand it. These
			companies also have been using carbon credits which have been proven to be bogus. Even when
			the project is something real, it is something like a monoculture forest; these projects are
			for lumber and will be cut down in a few years, and monocultures are prone to wildfires, as
			we've been seeing in Canada. Most scholars I respect conclude that to prevent climate collapse
			we must end capitalism. As Marc Fisher said after Frederic Jameson, it is easier to imagine
			the end of the world than the end of capitalism. We are soaring headfirst into that reality.
		</p>
		<p>
			It amazes me how common sense climate collapse prevention is, and all the knock on benefits it
			will bring. Burn less pollutants, have cleaner air and water. Reduce car dependence, have
			safer, quieter, cleaner cities. The more people walk and bike, the healthier they are. The
			more they interact with people in their community. The more they pay attention to their
			surroundings and their local environment. Shifting towards a more plant based diet, where food
			is grown locally, reduces both methane emmissions, inefficient land usage, and the suffering
			of conscious creatures who are exploited for their entire existence. We live our lives at an
			inhuman pace, and would be wise to return to a slower world.
		</p>
		<p>
			Despite this, the world isn't moving fast enough. America, the seat of empire, has grown
			fossil fuel production more than ever in the last few years. Cities and towns across the
			country resist the tide of change, refusing to invest in their public transit systems and
			other human scale transportation alternatives to the car. People are still eating meat,
			flying, driving, and buying products they don't need, all while the richest of the rich
			continue to reap profits to grow their already incomprehensible fortunes. Are they betting on
			their New Zealand climate bunkers to save them? What world will there be to inhabit? The GOP
			has the support of nearly half the country, and they are doing everything in their power to
			refuse the reality of climate change, and tear apart the world's ability to adequately respond
			to the danger.
		</p>
		<p>
			The window to save the world narrows every passing day. Save the world means limit warming to
			below 2 degrees Celsius. We are not anywhere close to that goal. What are we gonna do? Do
			people need to act like in Kim Stanley Robinson's Ministry for the Future, and perform extreme
			acts in the name of climate defense? Killing mass populations of cattle with bioengineered Mad
			Cow disease; taking down airplanes so no one feels safe enough to use them; assassinating the
			politicians and business leaders who continue to put their own self interest ahead of the
			interests of all humanity.
		</p>
		<p>
			So far the climate movement hasn't had that kind of edge to it. Actually, the so-called
			ecoterrorists of the 90s had an edge. They were often focused on saving forests. Today, the
			whole world is aware of the problem, and large swathes of the population, especially young
			people of my generation, see climate change to be the ultimate existential problem of our
			lifetime. PR campaigns like Just Stop Oil's infamous vandalism of famous cultural artifacts
			elicit a response, and have been able to get certain things done. However, it is still too
			little too slowly.
		</p>
		<p>
			Now, am I a hypocrite? Guess so. I'm not vegan, but I like to remind people that I was for 11
			months back in 2020. I haven't taken part in any Extinction Rebellion demonstrations. I just
			think and read and get upset and anxious and write on my little blog. What is there for
			someone like me to do?
