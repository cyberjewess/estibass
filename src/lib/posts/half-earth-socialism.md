I just finished reading the brilliant book _Half-Earth Socialism_ by Drew Pendergrass and
Troy Vettese. They argue that the best way to handle the ongoing climate catastrophe, and forge
a better society in its wake, is with a socialist planned economy rooted in scientific and ecological
principles. Ideally there is widespread veganism, with at least half of Earth's terrestrial area
given back to wild nature. This is a radical departure from today's status quo, and the authors
make a convincing case that it is both practical and feasible with today's technology. The authors
are explicitly charting out a utopian vision, with the goal of providing concrete ideas that bring
us closer to our goals of a sustainable global society where all human needs are met.

Underpinning this vision is an epistomological argument. The neoliberal order which controls
our world understands the economy to be so complex as to be ultimately unknowable and
uncontrollable. The Market is the supreme mechanism of knowledge production, which distributes
resources the most efficiently. Therefore, the argument follows, we should loosen as many
restrictions on it as possible, and let it lead us to utopia. Clearly, this isn't working.
Vettese and Pendergrass argue that Nature is even more unknowable than the Market. The Earth's
biosphere is so complex that any attempts to avoid climate catastrophe via geoengineering,
which is the Market's solution, is doomed to fail. At best, these measures, such as Solar
Radiation Management and large scale carbon capture, only prevent the inevitable, and likely
cause unforseen complications. The best solution for lasting change is to rewild the planet,
letting Mother Nature take back control of her climate, and consciously direct human economic
activity towards the sustainable flourishing of us all.

To this end, the book explores central planning in detail, with a large focus on cybernetics,
which is the study of feedback systems. It gives an extremely high level overview of the way
that overlapping layers of differential equations can be used to model the economy at
differing granularities, which is how contemporary climate and weather modelling works. This
completely removes money as a universal measure, instead opting for _in natura_
calculation, i.e. comparing different resource allocations directly. They also admit that while
capitalism has a tendency towards surplus, socialism has a tendency towards shortage. This seems
to be an inherent part of a planned system, made worse when incentives misalign, such as in the
Soviet system where planning departments who appeased the central bureaucry, without necessarily
being more efficient, retained decision making power. In order to combat this, planning must be
as democratic as possible. For example, a coarse grain plan can be drawn up based on supercomputer
simulations of the global economy, and finer grain plans can be created at more local levels to
meet the goals of the broader plan in bespoke ways. I'm excited to supplement this book with
_The People's Republic of Walmart_ (also from Verso) to learn more about how central planning
is already done at large scale within private enterprises.

Conservatism's strength lies in its clear vision for how society ought to be, with the policy
proposals to make it happen. _Half-Earth Socialism_ is an attempt to create that for the contemporary
Left. A socialist world is a utopia continuously created. Every human is cared for, fed, clothed,
and educated. No one is exploited or coerced into a life of toil and misery, as billions are under
today's neoliberal capitalist order. Humanity regains humility in our relation to Nature. We treat
the biosphere as a partner in shaping the conditions of our beautiful, unique world.

We live in dark times. The world is sick. This we can sense intuitively. Fascism continues to
rise; genocide and war abound in Palestine, Sudan, and Congo; ecological breakdown
accelerates, as we are witnessing with the aftermath of Hurricane Helene in southern
Appalachia. The rich get richer and we continue to burn fossil fuels. Things only seem to get
worse. We must fight harder, we must build bonds with each other, we must have a vision for
the world that we want to build, if we are to escape this hell. _Half-Earth Socialism_ doesn't
have all the answers, but it lays out a plan. We can disagree with it, iterate on it, mend it,
and improve it. We can take control of our destiny.

I highly recommend Ursula K. Le Guin's _The Dispossesed_ and Kim Stanley Robinson's
_Pacific Edge_ for some delicious ecosocialist utopian fiction. Godspeed!
